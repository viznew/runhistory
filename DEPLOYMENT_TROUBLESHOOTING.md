# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Your app is deployment-ready!**
- Project size: 247MB (within limits)
- All required files present
- Health endpoint working
- Dependencies installed
- FFmpeg available
- OPENAI_API_KEY configured

## Common Deployment Issues & Solutions

### 1. **Deployment Button Not Working**
**Symptoms:** Deploy button is grayed out or not responding
**Solutions:**
- Ensure you're in the main project directory
- Check if your Replit account has deployment permissions
- Try refreshing the page
- Make sure your project is saved (Ctrl+S)

### 2. **Deployment Fails During Build**
**Symptoms:** Build process stops or fails
**Solutions:**
- Check the build logs in the deployment tab
- Ensure `replit.yaml` is properly configured
- Verify all dependencies are in `pyproject.toml`

### 3. **Health Check Failing**
**Symptoms:** Deployment succeeds but health check fails
**Solutions:**
- Your health endpoint is working: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- Check if port 8000 is properly configured
- Verify environment variables are set

### 4. **Memory or Size Issues**
**Symptoms:** "Out of memory" or "Project too large" errors
**Solutions:**
- Your project is 247MB (optimal size)
- Generated files are cleaned up
- No large temporary files found

### 5. **Missing API Keys**
**Symptoms:** App deploys but features don't work
**Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ OPENAI_API_KEY is configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is missing (using fallback TTS)
- Add missing API keys in Replit Secrets

## Step-by-Step Deployment Process

1. **Click the Deploy Button** in your Replit workspace
2. **Choose "Autoscale Deployment"** (recommended)
3. **Configure Domain** (optional)
4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - OPENAI_API_KEY (already configured)
   - ELEVENLABS_API_KEY (optional - for better voice quality)
5. **Click "Deploy"**
6. **Wait for Build** (usually 5-10 minutes)
7. **Test Health Check** at `https://your-app.replit.app/health`

## If Deployment Still Fails

### Check Build Logs
1. Go to the Deploy tab
2. Click on your deployment
3. Check the "Build Logs" section
4. Look for error messages

### Common Error Messages & Fixes

**"Build failed":**
- Check if all files are saved
- Verify `replit.yaml` syntax
- Ensure `pyproject.toml` is valid

**"Health check timeout":**
- Increase health check timeout in `replit.yaml`
- Check if your app starts properly

**"Port binding failed":**
- Ensure your app uses port 8000
- Check `main.py` for correct port configuration

**"Out of memory":**
- Your app is optimized (247MB)
- Should not occur with current setup

## Manual Deployment Alternative

If automatic deployment fails, try manual deployment:

1. **Create a new deployment** 
2. **Choose "Custom"**
3. **Set run command:** `python main.py`
4. **Set port:** 8000
5. **Deploy**

## Get Help

If you're still having issues:
1. Check the specific error message in deployment logs
2. Share the exact error message for targeted help
3. Try deploying a minimal version first

## Current Configuration Summary

```yaml
# replit.yaml (working configuration)
deployment:
  run: python main.py
  deploymentTarget: cloudrun
  healthCheckPath: /health
  healthCheckTimeout: 60
  healthCheckInterval: 15
  env:
    PORT: "8000"
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED: "1"
```

Your app is optimized and ready for deployment! üöÄ
