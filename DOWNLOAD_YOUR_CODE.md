```

## Once You Have Your Code

1. **Create a new folder** on your computer
2. **Put all the files** in the same structure as shown above
3. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Set your API key**: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
5. **Run locally**: `python main.py`
6. **Test at**: `http://localhost:8000`
