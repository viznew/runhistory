1. Click the "Share" button in the top-right of your Replit
2. Click "Make repl public"
3. Your app is now publicly accessible at your Replit URL

## Method 3: Use ngrok (If you have a computer)

1. Download ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Run: `ngrok http 8000` (in a new terminal)
3. Copy the https URL it gives you
4. Share that URL

## Method 4: Deploy to Render (5 minutes)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to render.com
3. "New Web Service" → Connect GitHub → Select your repo
4. Set start command: `python main.py`

## The Easiest Option: Use Your Current Replit URL

Your app is working perfectly right now. Just:

3. They can use your app immediately!

## For Facebook Sharing

Once you have your URL:

2. Or manually post: "Check out this AI video generator: [your-url]"

## No Complex Deployment Needed

Your app is already functional and accessible. The deployment issues you're having are just with formal deployment processes - but your app works fine as-is for sharing and using.

**Bottom line**: Your Replit URL is your deployment. Share it and people can use your app immediately.
