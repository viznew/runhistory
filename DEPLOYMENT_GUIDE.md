# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
Your app is running locally and all technical requirements are met:
- ✅ Health check endpoint working (`/health` returns 200)
- ✅ Main endpoint working (`/` returns 200)
- ✅ All dependencies installed (FastAPI, FFmpeg, etc.)
- ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY is set
- ✅ All required files present

## Common Deployment Issues & Solutions

### 1. **Manual Deployment Steps**
If automatic deployment isn't working:

1. **Click the Deploy button** in your Replit interface
2. **Wait for build process** - this can take 2-5 minutes
3. **Check deployment logs** for specific error messages

### 2. **Environment Variables**
Make sure these are set in your deployment environment:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for script generation
- `PORT` - Should be automatically set by Replit

### 3. **Resource Requirements**
Your app uses FFmpeg which requires additional resources:
- Make sure you have sufficient compute resources
- Consider upgrading to Replit Pro if needed

### 4. **Deployment Configuration**
Current configuration in `replit.yaml`:
```yaml
deployment:
  run: python main.py
  deploymentTarget: cloudrun
  healthCheckPath: /health
  healthCheckTimeout: 30
  healthCheckInterval: 10
```

### 5. **Alternative Deployment Methods**
If Cloud Run fails, try:
- Static deployment (for frontend-only)
- Docker deployment (using the Dockerfile provided)
- Manual server setup

## Quick Fixes to Try

1. **Restart deployment**: Cancel current deployment and try again
2. **Check quotas**: Ensure you haven't exceeded deployment limits
3. **Simplify app**: Temporarily remove FFmpeg dependency for testing
4. **Contact support**: If all else fails, reach out to Replit support

## Test Your Deployment
After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-app.replit.app/health` - Should return {"status": "healthy"}
- `https://your-app.replit.app/` - Should show the main page
